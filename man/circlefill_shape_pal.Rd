\title{Filled Circle Shape palette (discrete)}
\usage{
circlefill_shape_pal()
}
\description{
`r lifecycle::badge("deprecated")`

This function was deprecated because unicode glyphs used for the circles
vary in size, making them unusable for plotting.

Shape palette with circles varying by amount of fill. This uses
the set of 3 circle fill values in Lewandowsky and Spence (1989):
solid, hollow, half-filled, with two additional fill amounts:
three-quarters, and one-quarter.

This palette supports up to five values.
