\usage{
geom_tufteboxplot(
  mapping = NULL,
  data = NULL,
  stat = "fivenumber",
  position = "dodge",
  outlier.colour = "black",
  outlier.shape = 19,
  outlier.size = 1.5,
  outlier.stroke = 0.5,
  voffset = 0.01,
  hoffset = 0.005,

  median.type = "point",

  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mapping}{Set of aesthetic mappings created by \code{\link[ggplot2:aes]{aes()}}. If specified and
\code{inherit.aes = TRUE} (the default), it is combined with the default mapping
at the top level of the plot. You must supply \code{mapping} if there is no plot
mapping.}

\item{data}{The data to be displayed in this layer. There are three
options:

If \code{NULL}, the default, the data is inherited from the plot
data as specified in the call to \code{\link[ggplot2:ggplot]{ggplot()}}.

A \code{data.frame}, or other object, will override the plot
data. All objects will be fortified to produce a data frame. See
\code{\link[ggplot2:fortify]{fortify()}} for which variables will be created.

A \code{function} will be called with a single argument,
the plot data. The return value must be a \code{data.frame}, and
will be used as the layer data. A \code{function} can be created
from a \code{formula} (e.g. \code{~ head(.x, 10)}).}

\item{stat}{The statistical transformation to use on the data for this
layer, as a string. The default (\code{stat = 'fivenumber'}) calls
\code{\link{stat_fivenumber}} and produces whiskers that extend
from the interquartile range to the extremes of the data; specifying
\code{\link{stat_boxplot}} will produce a more traditional boxplot
with whiskers extending to the most extreme points that are < 1.5 IQR
away from the hinges (i.e., the first and third quartiles).}

\item{position}{Position adjustment, either as a string naming the adjustment
(e.g. \code{"jitter"} to use \code{position_jitter}), or the result of a call to a
position adjustment function. Use the latter if you need to change the
settings of the adjustment.}

\item{outlier.colour}{colour for outlying points}

\item{outlier.shape}{shape of outlying points}

\item{outlier.size}{size of outlying points}

\item{outlier.stroke}{stroke for outlying points}

\item{voffset}{controls the size of the gap in the line representing the
median when \code{median.type = 'line'}. This is a fraction of the range
of \code{y}.}

\item{hoffset}{controls how much the interquartile line is offset from the
whiskers when \code{median.type = 'line'}. This is a fraction of the
range of \code{x}.}

\item{na.rm}{If \code{FALSE}, the default, missing values are removed with
a warning. If \code{TRUE}, missing values are silently removed.}

\item{show.legend}{logical. Should this layer be included in the legends?
\code{NA}, the default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped.
\code{FALSE} never includes, and \code{TRUE} always includes.
It can also be a named logical vector to finely select the aesthetics to
display.}

\item{inherit.aes}{If \code{FALSE}, overrides the default aesthetics,
rather than combining with them. This is most useful for helper functions
that define both data and aesthetics and shouldn't inherit behaviour from
the default plot specification, e.g. \code{\link[ggplot2:borders]{borders()}}.}

\item{median.type}{If \code{'point'}, then the median is represented by a
point, and the interquartile range by a gap in the line. If
\code{median.type='line'}, then the interquartile range is represented by
a line, possibly offset, and the median by a gap in the line.}

\item{whisker.type}{If \code{'line'}, then whiskers are represented by lines.
If \code{'point'}, then whiskers are represented by points at
\code{ymin} and \code{ymax}.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed on to \code{\link[ggplot2:layer]{layer()}}. These are
often aesthetics, used to set an aesthetic to a fixed value, like
\code{colour = "red"} or \code{size = 3}. They may also be parameters
to the paired geom/stat.}

\description{
Edward Tufte's revisions of the box plot as described in
\emph{The Visual Display of Quantitative Information}.
This functions provides several box plot variants:
\itemize{
\item{A point indicating the median, a gap indicating the
  interquartile range, and lines for whiskers.}
\item{An offset line indicating the interquartile range
      and a gap indicating the median.}
\item{A line indicating the interquartile range,
      a gap indicating the median, and points indicating
      the minimum and maximum values}
\item{A  wide line indicating the interquartile range,
      a gap indicating the median, and lines indicating the minimum and
      maximum.}
}
