\description{
Themes based on Stata graph schemes
}
\details{
These themes approximate Stata schemes using the features
\pkg{ggplot2}. The graphical models of Stata and ggplot2 differ
in various ways that make an exact replication impossible (or
more difficult than it is worth).
Some features in Stata schemes not in ggplot2:
defaults for specific graph types, different levels of titles,
captions and notes. These themes also adopt some of the ggplot2
defaults, and more effort was made to match the colors and sizes
of major elements than in matching the margins.

\examples{
library("ggplot2")

p <- ggplot(mtcars) +
  geom_point(aes(x = wt, y = mpg, colour = factor(gear))) +
  facet_wrap(~am) +
  labs(
    title = "Graphs by car type",
    x = "Weight (lbs.)", y = "MPG"
  )

# s2color
p + theme_stata() +
  scale_colour_stata("s2color")
# s2mono
p + theme_stata(scheme = "s2mono") +
  scale_colour_stata("mono")
# s1color
p + theme_stata(scheme = "s2color") +
  scale_colour_stata("s1color")
# s1rcolor
p + theme_stata(scheme = "s1rcolor") +
  scale_colour_stata("s1rcolor")
# s1mono
p + theme_stata(scheme = "s1mono") +
  scale_colour_stata("mono")
