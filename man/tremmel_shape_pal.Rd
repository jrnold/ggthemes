\title{Shape palette from Tremmel (1995) (discrete)}
\usage{
tremmel_shape_pal(overlap = FALSE, alt = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{overlap}{use an empty circle instead of a solid circle when
\code{n == 2}.}

\item{alt}{If \code{TRUE}, then when \code{n == 3},
use a solid circle, plus sign and
empty triangle. Otherwise use a solid circle, empty circle, and empty
triangle.}
}
\description{
Based on experiments Tremmel (1995) suggests the following shape palettes:
}
\details{
If two symbols, then use a solid circle and plus sign.

If three symbols, then use a solid circle, empty circle, and an
empty triangle. However, that set of symbols does not satisfy the
requirement that each symbol should differ from the other symbols
in the same feature dimension. A set of three symbols that
satisfies this is a circle (curvature), plus sign (number of
terminators), triangle (line orientation).

This palette supports up to three values.
If more than three groups of data, then separate the groups into
different plots.
