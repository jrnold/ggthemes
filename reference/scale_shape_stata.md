# Stata shape scale

See
[`stata_shape_pal()`](http://jrnold.github.io/ggthemes/reference/stata_shape_pal.md)
for details.

## Usage

``` r
scale_shape_stata(...)
```

## Arguments

- ...:

  Arguments passed on to
  [`discrete_scale`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/discrete_scale.html)

  `breaks`

  :   One of:

      - `NULL` for no breaks

      - [`waiver()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/waiver.html)
        for the default breaks (the scale limits)

      - A character vector of breaks

      - A function that takes the limits as input and returns breaks as
        output. Also accepts rlang
        [lambda](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/as_function.html)
        function notation.

  `limits`

  :   One of:

      - `NULL` to use the default scale values

      - A character vector that defines possible values of the scale and
        their order

      - A function that accepts the existing (automatic) values and
        returns new ones. Also accepts rlang
        [lambda](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/as_function.html)
        function notation.

  `drop`

  :   Should unused factor levels be omitted from the scale? The
      default, `TRUE`, uses the levels that appear in the data; `FALSE`
      includes the levels in the factor. Please note that to display
      every level in a legend, the layer should use
      `show.legend = TRUE`.

  `na.translate`

  :   Unlike continuous scales, discrete scales can easily show missing
      values, and do so by default. If you want to remove missing values
      from a discrete scale, specify `na.translate = FALSE`.

  `na.value`

  :   If `na.translate = TRUE`, what aesthetic value should the missing
      values be displayed as? Does not apply to position scales where
      `NA` is always placed at the far right.

  `aesthetics`

  :   The names of the aesthetics that this scale works with.

  `minor_breaks`

  :   One of:

      - `NULL` for no minor breaks

      - [`waiver()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/waiver.html)
        for the default breaks (none for discrete, one minor break
        between each major break for continuous)

      - A numeric vector of positions

      - A function that given the limits returns a vector of minor
        breaks. Also accepts rlang
        [lambda](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/as_function.html)
        function notation. When the function has two arguments, it will
        be given the limits and major break positions.

  `labels`

  :   One of the options below. Please note that when `labels` is a
      vector, it is highly recommended to also set the `breaks` argument
      as a vector to protect against unintended mismatches.

      - `NULL` for no labels

      - [`waiver()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/waiver.html)
        for the default labels computed by the transformation object

      - A character vector giving labels (must be same length as
        `breaks`)

      - An expression vector (must be the same length as breaks). See
        ?plotmath for details.

      - A function that takes the breaks as input and returns labels as
        output. Also accepts rlang
        [lambda](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/as_function.html)
        function notation.

  `call`

  :   The `call` used to construct the scale for reporting messages.

  `super`

  :   The super class to use for the constructed scale

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{
library("ggplot2")

p <- ggplot(mtcars) +
     geom_point(aes(x = wt, y = mpg, shape = factor(gear))) +
     facet_wrap(~am)
p + theme_stata() + scale_shape_stata()
} # }
```
